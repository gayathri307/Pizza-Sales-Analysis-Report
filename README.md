# Pizza Sales Analysis 
### Problem Statement:
Stakeholders in the pizza sales industry seek to understand sales variations and customer preferences to optimize their offerings. They aim to identify popular pizza types, analyze daily trends, and discern customer preferences based on pizza category (veg or non-veg) and size. Additionally, they want insights into top and bottom-selling pizzas to inform their marketing and production strategies.

### Task List:
1. Import and clean data: Retrieve data from SQL and eliminate duplicates, missing values, and blanks.

3. Visualize insights:
   - Daily trend for total orders.
   - Monthly trends for total orders.
   - Percentage of sales by pizza category.

   - Bottom 5 pizzas by orders.
5. Implement slicers:
   - Slicer for pizza category to filter visuals.
   - Slicer for order date with a slider for time-based analysis.
